# stats220

## *This is my repo for STATS 220.* 

***A little about me:***

1. I am undertaking a degree in **Information Technology and Management** (ITM)
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I found the overall course outline for 220 to be interesting and was a highly recommendable paper based from my friends who have previously taken STATS 220 before. 
3. I am interested in learning about R language as a I deepen my basic outlook and knowledge about R and slightly revise my knowledge of HTML.

* A website that I like because of its aesthetics is [Aceship](https://puppiizsunniiz.github.io/AN-EN-Tags/akhrchars.html).

* A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif) and ![https://tenor.com/en-GB/view/yuru-camp-kagamihara-nadeshiko-sleep-nadeshiko-gif-27053496]
